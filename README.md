# An-Analysis-of-the-Bud-Light-Transgender-Advertisement-Strategy
I analyze the causal impact of Bud Light's recent transgender advertisement fiasco in 2023 using time-series financial data. 

In April of 2023, Bud Light ran an advertisement campaign featuring prominent transgender social media star Dylan Mulvaney.

The campaign celebrated both March Madness & Mulvaney's first year of womanhood. In fact, the promotional cans featured her image prominently displayed. 

Needless to say, Bud Light's core demographic did not take kindly to this somewhat political gesture. 

After the campaign, conservative media and other social media figures voiced their displeasure & started to boycott the product entirely. 

In fact, a viral video of Kid Rock shows him shooting cans of Bud Light beer with Mulvaney's face on it.

Similarly, other country stars like Travis Tritt publicly banned the beverage from his tour. 

And, liquor stores and bars across middle-America are no longer purchasing the beverage to stock the shelves. 

Given this context, I wanted to analyze the impact of this advertisement disaster from a data science perspective. 

To do so, I created a structural Bayesian time-series model using the Causal Impact package in R. 

Moreover, I utilized time-series financial data of stock prices. 

Ultimately, I found that Bud Light's stock price dropped by 30% over the next four months after the scandal was publicized. 
Moreover, their stock never recovered.

For full information, please refer to my write-up from the Word Document in this Repository. 

Obviously, you can also reproduce my findings using the same R code provided as well. 

In fact, I would welcome improvements to my model & the time horizon I used, given I am doing this analysis as the story is still developing.
